## ✏️ How to Add a New Book

1. Open `data/books.js` in Notepad (or any text editor)
2. Find the line that says `// ---- ADD MORE BOOKS BELOW ----`
3. Copy this and add it after the last book's closing `}`:

```js
,
{
  id: 2,
  title: "Your Book Title",
  subtitle: "A Textbook for CBSE Class IX",
  author: "Chinnu",
  editor: "Dr. Seema",
  price: 350,
  cover: "assets/book2-cover.jpg",
  badge: "New Arrival",
  isbn: "978-XXX-XXXXX-X",
  description: "Brief description of the book.",
  boardTag: "CBSE",
  classTag: "Class IX",
  inStock: true
}
```

4. Save the file. Refresh your browser — book appears automatically.
5. Place the book cover image in the `assets/` folder with the same name you put in `cover:`.

## ✏️ How to Add a Team Member

1. Open `data/authors.js` in Notepad
2. Add a new block after the last team member (same pattern)
3. Place their photo in `assets/` folder

---

## 🖼️ How to Add Your Logo & Photos

1. Open the `assets/` folder
2. Place your files with these exact names:
   - **Logo**: `logo.png`
   - **Book cover**: `book-cover.jpg`
   - **Chief Editor photo**: `chief-editor.jpg`
   - **Author photo**: `author-Chinnu.jpg`

If the file is missing, the site shows initials (e.g., "BS") automatically — so nothing breaks.

## 🌐 How to Host on GitHub Pages (Free)

### First Time Setup:

1. **Create a GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com) (free)

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Click "New" → name it `chenyixpublications` (or your domain)
   - Set it to **Public**
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload your files**:
   - Open the repository
   - Drag and drop the entire `chenyix_site/` folder contents (NOT the folder itself, the files inside)
   - Commit (save)

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under "Source" select: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

5. **Your site is live!**
   - URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/chenyixpublications/`
   - Takes 1–2 minutes to go live

### GitHub's Role:
- GitHub acts as your **free web server** and **file host**
- GitHub Pages converts your HTML files into a live website
- Every time you update a file, the website updates within ~2 minutes
- You can point a custom domain (e.g., `www.chenyixpublications.com`) to it later
